##### Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle

NAIP

It represents one U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangle. The Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle, (DOQQ) represents one quarter of the quadrangle. The names are based on that of the 7.5-minute quad, followed by NE, NW, SW, or SE for the DOQQ. The DOQQâ€™s scale is 1:12,000 scale or 1"=1,000', with 1-meter pixel resolution, and accuracy of +/ 33 feet. Individual states may have DOQ's that have higher accuracy standards depending on additional post-processing.

## Contributing

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the
[STAC specification contributing guide](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) Instructions
for running tests are copied here for convenience.

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid. 
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on 
your command line run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:
```bash
npm run format-examples
```
